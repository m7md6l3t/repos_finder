# 🔍 Repos Finder

A simple Python tool to filter and analyze GitHub repository data from a JSON list.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `run.py` — Main script that processes or filters repositories.
- `repos_list.json` — Input file containing raw repository data.
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies for running the script.

## 🚀 Usage

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
````

2. **Run the script**

   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```

   > Make sure `repos_list.json` is in the same directory as `run.py`.

## ⚙️ Features

* Filters repositories based on custom criteria
* Outputs or processes results (you can describe more here based on what `run.py` does)

## 📝 Input Format

`repos_list.json` should be a JSON array of repository objects like:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "example-repo",
    "url": "https://github.com/user/example-repo",
    "language": "Python"
  },
  ...
]
```

> You can adjust this section based on your actual JSON format.

## 📦 Requirements

* Python 3.8+
* See `requirements.txt` for full package list
```
